hard childhood taught me early to make comparisons between poor and rich.  Out of the "Chemnitzer Volksstimme" [Chemnitz People's Voice] (Party newspaper of the social democrats for the Chamnitz area) and the "Wahre Jakob" [The Real McCoy] (satirical weekly newspaper of the SPD) I received the first political impressions that I still remember today.
