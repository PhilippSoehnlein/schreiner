# Albert H Schreiner

*Albert Schreiner* was my Great-grandfather. He was a German emmigrant in the run up to WWII, fleeing to the US whilst my grandmother made it to the UK where she remained until her death in 1998. Albert returned to East Germany after WWII and this document is a short biography of his life written in 1978, the year before he died.

As an English speaker I am seeking German-speaking folk to help translate this 21 page document.

## Document:

The document can be found in the *assets* folder of this repository.

## Method:

To contribute please make a [fork of the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and update the [contributors page of the Wiki](https://github.com/cole007/schreiner/wiki/Contributors) outling your Github username (registration is free), which pages you are translating, the date you have claimed the page and - once complete - the date you have completed the translation.

Files should ideally be saved as 'schreiner-page[N].md' (where [N] is the page number you are translating) in [the Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Each page should include a summary block with the Page number, Date and contributor/translators name. I've included schreiner-page1.md as an example.

Once you have completed a page please make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to have your files pulled back into the master repository.

If you do not wish to use Github to contribute then [email via my profile page](https://github.com/cole007/) and I can manually update your contribution(s).

If you think there are any issues with some of the translations submitted then please [file an issue](https://github.com/cole007/schreiner/issues) stating the page in question and the correct translation. 

Many thanks in advance for your help. Schüß!
