# Albert H Schreiner

*Albert Schreiner* was my Great-grandfather. He was a German emmigrant in the run up to WWII, fleeing to the US whilst my grandmother made it to the UK where she remained until her death in 1998. Albert returned to East Germany after WWII and this document is a short biography of his life written in 1978, the year before he died.

As an English speaker I am seeking German-speaking folk to help translate this 21 page document.

## Document:

The document can be found in the *assets* folder of this repository.

## Method:

To contribute please contact me via [my Github profile page](https://github.com/cole007) with your Github username (registration is free) and I will add you as a contributor.

Files should ideally be saved as 'schreiner-page[N].md' (where [N] is the page number you are translating) in [the Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Each page should include a summary block with the Page number, Date and contributor/translators name. I've included schreiner-page1.md as an example.

The table below should be kept updated as to which pages are claimed and which are completed.  
If you do not wish to use Github to contribute then email via the link above and I can manually update your contribution(s).

Many thanks in advance for your help. Schüß!
